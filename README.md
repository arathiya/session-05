# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
  * AI which helps us to enable the machine to think .
    *Eg. self driving car is the AI.
 * The AI is the theory and development of omputer system able to perform tasks normally required human intelligence such as visual perception ,speech recognition, decision making and translation between language.
 * AI is a techinique of getting machines to work and behave like humans. In the rest past AI has been able to accomplish this by creating machine and robots that have used in wide range of fields including health care robotics and many more.
## Artificial General Intelligence
## History of Artificial Intelligence
* 1950 - is the introduction of AI.
        - 1950 Alen turing published a paper in which he speculated about the probability of creating machine that 
          think. 
        - So he created What is known as turing test.
        - This test is basically used to determine whether or not computer can think intelligently like a human being.
        - He noted that thinking is difficult to define and sevised his famous turing test.
        - It was the reasonable to say that the machine is thinking meaning that the machine will pass the turing test.
* 1951 - By the using Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the university of manchester a computer scientist known as Christoper 
         strachey.
       - Christoper Strachey wrote a chekers program and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess.
* 1956 - The term Artificial Intelligence was coined.
       - John mccarthy first coined the first Artificial Intelligence in 1956 at the Dartmouth conference.
* 1959 - The first AI laboratory was established.
       - The first AI lab MIT AI lab was first set up in 1959 the reserch on AI began.
* 1960 - First robot was introduced to general motor assembly line .
* 1961 - The first AI chatbot called ELIZA was introduced.
* 1997 - IBM deep blue beats world chambion garry kasparov in the game of chess.
* 2005 - Stanford Racing teams autonomous robotic car stannley win the 2005 DARPA Grand challenge.
       - This is the other big accomblishment of AI.
* 2011 - IBM's question answering system Waston defeated the two greatest jeopardy chambions Brand Ratter and Ken Jenning.
### Perceptron
* A perceptron is a fundamental algorithm in artificial intelligence and machine learning, serving as the         simplest type of artificial neural network. 
* It is a binary classifier used in supervised learning, designed to categorize input data into one of two classes. * Here's a breakdown of its key components and functionality
*the perceptrone having two types they are:
                                  * Single layer perceptrone
                                   * Multi layer perceptrone
* Single layer perceptrone : A type of perceptron is limited to learning linearly separable patterns. It is effective for tasks where the data can be divided into distinct categories through a straight line. While powerful in its simplicity, it struggles with more complex problems where the relationship between inputs and outputs is non-linear.
*Multi-Layer Perceptron : possess enhanced processing capabilities as they consist of two or more layers, adept at handling more complex patterns and relationships within the data.
*The four basic components of a perceptron are input,weight,bias and an activation function.
*Inputs (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ): These are the features or attributes of the input data.
*Weights (w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ): Each input is associated with a weight, which determines its importance in the classification decision.
*Bias (b): An additional parameter that allows the model to adjust the output independently of the inputs.
*Activation Function: A function that determines the output of the perceptron based on the weighted sum of inputs and bias. For a basic perceptron, this is typically a step function.


### Backpropagation
* Backpropagation, short for backward propagation of errors  is a fundamental algorithm in 
 artificial intelligence and machine learning used to train artificial neural networks. It is a 
 supervised learning technique that minimizes the error between the predicted output of the 
 network and the actual target output by adjusting the weights of the network. Here's a detailed *explanation of how backpropagation works:
*Purpose:
 Backpropagation is used to minimize the error (or loss) in a neural network by adjusting the 
 weights and biases of the network's connections. 
* How it Works:
* Forward Propagation: First, input data is fed through the network, and predictions are made. 
* Calculate Loss: The difference between the predicted output and the actual output (the "loss" 
  or "error") is calculated. 
* Backward Propagation: The error is then propagated backward through the network, layer by 
  layer, from the output layer to the input layer. 
* Adjust Weights: During the backward pass, the algorithm calculates how much each weight and 
  bias contributed to the error and adjusts them accordingly to reduce the error in future 
  predictions. 
* Gradient Descent : Backpropagation is often used in conjunction with gradient descent, an 
  optimization algorithm that helps find the minimum of a function (in this case, the loss 
  function). 
* Supervised Learning : Backpropagation is a supervised learning method, meaning it requires 
  labeled data (inputs and corresponding outputs) to train the neural network. 
* Efficiency : Backpropagation is computationally efficient, allowing for the training of 
  complex, multi-layered neural networks. 
* Chain Rule : The backpropagation algorithm leverages the chain rule of calculus to efficiently 
  compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network weights. 
* Activation Functions : Activation functions are used in neurons to introduce non-linearity, 
  enabling the network to learn complex patterns.

### AI Winter
* An AI winter is a period when interest and funding for artificial intelligence (AI) research 
  and development decreases. The term "winter" is used to describe a temporary phase that will 
  eventually lead to renewed growth. 
* Causes of AI winters
    * Over-promises: Developers over-promise what AI can do. 
    * High expectations: End users have unrealistically high expectations of AI. 
    * Media promotion: Extensive media promotion can lead to inflated expectations. 
    * Limited capabilities: AI programs may have limited capabilities.
    * Restrictive legislation: Regulations that are too restrictive can hinder AI research and 
      development. 
    * Lack of data: A lack of relevant and high-quality data can hinder the development of AI 
      models. 
* Effects of AI winters 
   * Disillusionment :
            Disillusionment with AI can lead to a loss of funding, talent, and interest in AI.
    * Missed opportunities :
            AI winters can lead to missed opportunities for groundbreaking technologies.
    * Skepticism :
            AI winters can foster skepticism, making it harder for innovations to gain traction
